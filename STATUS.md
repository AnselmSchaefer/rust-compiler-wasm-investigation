## Measurements
- 2026-10-23 engine probe: Chromium and Firefox (Playwright 1.64.1) both have COI, SAB, shared memory, exnref EH, JSPI, memory64, OPFS.
- Smoke: hello world runs on wasip1, wasip2, wasip3 (wasmtime 50) and wasip1-threads with a real thread (wasmtime 46.0.3).

## Session log
- 2026-10-23 (session 2): WP-00. Installed nightly + Wasm targets, pnpm, jco, wasmtime 50 + 46, wasm-tools, sccache, wasi-sdk-34, Playwright. Found wasi-threads removed in wasmtime 47. WebKit can't run on Arch, so it's opt-in.
- 2026-10-23 (session 1): planning only, no code yet.
